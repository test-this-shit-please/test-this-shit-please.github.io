# Test This Shit

We are a team of testers that your programmers will hate, but you will love us for helping improve your product and saving you time, money, and nerves.

If you are involved in development yourself, it will be much more effective for you to engage an external testing team rather than maintaining your own testers.

### How much does it cost?
